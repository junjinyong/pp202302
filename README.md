### Questions

- Ask questions in the [GitHub repository issue tracker](https://github.com/snu-sf-class/pp202302/issues).
- When you post a piece of source code, use ["fenced code blocks" feature](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/)
```scala
def foo(x:Int) = x + 3
foo(10)
```
- Or, you can use [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/).

### Scala

- Starting this year, we will NOT use the old **Scala 2**. You must use Scala 3.
- Latest version: [3.3.0](https://www.scala-lang.org/)
- Use IDEs to write a Scala program.
  - IntelliJ IDEA, VSCode, Eclipse, Emacs, etc
  - VSCode will be used from both tutorial and exam.
  - We do not recommend to depend on Copilot. Our clone checker may detect your code as a copied script.

### Rust

- Latest version: [1.72.0](https://www.rust-lang.org)
- We recommend VSCode editor for Rust.

#### Honor Code: _DO NOT CHEAT_
